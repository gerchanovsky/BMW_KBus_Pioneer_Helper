If your JQ6500 is missing the MusicDownload.exe File on it's virtual "CD Drive" then you can try these ones.
 
Pick the one appropriate for your memory size of JQ6500, plug in your JQ6500 via usb, then run the MusicDownload.exe file.

NB: The executable is the same for all of them, only the config file differs.
